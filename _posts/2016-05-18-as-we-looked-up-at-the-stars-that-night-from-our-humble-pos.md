description: "As we looked up at the stars that night, from our humble position on earth, I began to think of the great irony going on. It's the city lights that drown our view of this beautiful universe we find ourselves in, not because they are bigger, brighter, or in any way more magnificent, but simply because they are closer. The things we have created have in turn literally have blinded us. In this I find the great metaphor of my life, it is that which is close the distorts my view of that which is magnificent. I can't see through the light pollution, the distraction, therefore I do not see that which is truly important. What light pollution exists in my life? What keeps me from seeing past the distraction in front me? How can I change my perspective? "

As we looked up at the stars that night, from our humble position on earth, I began to think of the great irony going on. It's the city lights that drown our view of this beautiful universe we find ourselves in, not because they are bigger, brighter, or in any way more magnificent, but simply because they are closer. The things we have created have in turn literally have blinded us. In this I find the great metaphor of my life, it is that which is close the distorts my view of that which is magnificent. I can't see through the light pollution, the distraction, therefore I do not see that which is truly important. What light pollution exists in my life?
